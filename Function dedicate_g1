# Function that solves for the number of bonds that should be purchased given the price of each bond, the coupon for each bond
# the maturity for each bond and the liabilities each year. 
# Only constraint that must be followed while inputting the arrays are: the maturity year of the last bond should be equal to the number 
# of years of liabilities. This means we need some form of income/coupon from each bond till our liabilities are over. 
# Inputs: P-> array of prices 
# C-> Array of coupons
# M->array of maturity
# L-> Array of liabilites
